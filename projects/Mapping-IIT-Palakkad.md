[OpenStreetMap] is a world wide project for mapping the entire
earth. It runs with volunteer effort and releases the data for
free. Many other free and commercial products depend on this data for
their cartographic needs. The project aim is to map IIT Palakkad and
its locality. This can solve some of our navigational problems in the
campus.

## Background knowledge

There is very little programming experience that you will need for
this project. A lot of contributions can be done just by looking at
the satellite image based interface on the [OpenStreetMap]. If you
travel a lot and use gps devices you can create roads by appropriate gps
traces. For more details please check the the wikipage
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contribute_map_data

## How to contribute?

1. You will need to create a username on the
   [OpenStreetMap website][openstreetmap]. If you have a github account
   you can use it for authentication.

2. Mapping can be done using their interface.

3. For more accurate positioning you might need GPS devices.

## What to contribute?

1. Main roads
2. Land marks
3. Cycling tracks
4. Rivers, land use, forests etc.

Let loose the cartographer in you.

## Future work.

Building applications that make use of these data.
